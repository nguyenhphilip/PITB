In truth they are masks, transient facades that hide a more true and vulnerable sense of self.\n\nWe put these masks on when we're scared, when we're too afraid to ask for attention and love; when we're on the verge of breaking, but don't know how to ask for help. When we're in search of something solid in the face of groundlessness. Even happiness is something we try too hard to hold onto, strangling it of all significance in the process.\n\nFeelings are signals: they point toward ourselves, toward the unknown. But they are not us.\n\nTo take this non-attached perspective is more terrifying than the feelings themselves; we would rather feel angry and sad than risk being a lonely drop in the ocean. \"Yet what is an ocean but a multitude of drops?\" Non-attachment is not detachment. Detaching is active avoidance whereas non-attachment is active engagement––detachment runs while non-attachment sits and feels and notices with non-judgment.\n\nFrom the vantage of non-attachment, we can see our feelings as they truly are: simply feelings, waves that come and go like the seasons; things as permanent as the illusory grounds they stand upon.\n\nThen who are we if not our feelings?
