{"title":"Forgiveness","markdown":{"yaml":{"date":"01-09-2018","title":"Forgiveness"},"containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n\nForgiveness moves us toward a better future by inviting us to look at the past, at the unrelenting, painful ghosts that continue to permeate and darken each of our lives.\n\nSometimes we need to feel rage, to tussle with guilt, to fall into our sorrows before we can forgive. No, forgiveness is not about avoiding these emotions. Rather, forgiveness asks us to show up daily with unwavering courage, compassion, receptivity, and kindness. It asks us if we are ready to build the bridge on which only we can cross in order to move beyond our past selves. Forgiveness is answering the call for a spiritual freedom.\n\nForgiveness is a process. We know intellectually why we should forgive, but Truth is something that must be felt within our bones.\n\nForgiveness is not easy. It takes work.\n\nForgiveness does not always mean to let the other back into our lives. We may still declare, “I do not want you here. I do not want you in my life.” \n\nIt is the release of our psychic terrors; it is a letting go of the anger, rage, and suffering we have brought onto ourselves under the guise of their name. Forgiveness moves past victimhood and emboldens action. Forgiveness is ultimately for the forgiver.\n\nForgiveness asks us to let go of the pain we’ve held onto so long. It asks us to realize our own power. It asks us to make room for love. It asks us to embrace what is.\n\nForgiveness asks us if we are ready to live again. It asks us if we are ready to risk getting hurt again in order to participate in the game of life. \n\n![](/photos/forgive.jpg)","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nForgiveness moves us toward a better future by inviting us to look at the past, at the unrelenting, painful ghosts that continue to permeate and darken each of our lives.\n\nSometimes we need to feel rage, to tussle with guilt, to fall into our sorrows before we can forgive.
