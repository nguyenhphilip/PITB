This blog is a home to my projects and an archive for my [writing](https://philintheblank.substack.com).\n\nBy day I'm a graduate student in [Complex Systems and Data Science](https://vermontcomplexsystems.org) working on the [ABCD Study](https://abcdstudy.org). My research interests include: youth resilience, mental health, network science, and complex systems.\n\nBy night (or when I'm not playing academic) you can find me reading, writing, playing guitar, slacklining, practicing handstands, or taking long walks with no particular destination in mind. The former provides me an interface with the world. The latter feeds and fulfills my soul.\n\nSometimes I feel like a lonely wanderer, so if you feel inclined to chat with me about life, your work, and other miscellaneous things, feel free to reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NguyenHPhil)! I would love to connect."},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","theme":"ember.scss","title":"","image":"photos/me.jpg","page-layout":"article"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
