### Running

&nbsp;

::: poem
-   They asked for his time,
-   not how he got here.
-   Let me wonder then:
-   &nbsp;
-   Did he stumble?
-   Did his body crumble
-   at all like
-   a soggy crepe
-   held up by sticks
-   on his way
-   to some
-   pre-determined
-   somewhere?
-   &nbsp;
-   Or did he bumble
-   like a bee, all grace
-   & no trace of
-   a single step,
-   every toe kissing
-   the asphalt
-   as if it were
-   dirt?
-   &nbsp;
-   The numbers reveal
-   one thing while hiding
-   everything else.
