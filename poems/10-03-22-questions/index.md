<div class = "poem">
* There goes the body again
* trying to find answers
* where only questions exist.
* &nbsp;
* Where do we go from here?
* Why does hope feel so heavy?
* Who am I without love and direction?
* &nbsp;
* Rilke said to live
* the questions, as if
* by following the curves
* &nbsp;
* of their bodies
* you would be led
* to the full-stop of your life.
* &nbsp;
* Of course,
* everyone has their answers
* and I am still here
* &nbsp;
* writing of curves and bodies.
* Such is life they say.
* Did Rilke live his?
