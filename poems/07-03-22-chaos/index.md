<div class = "poem">
* I hold the world
* In a single equation.
* &nbsp;
* *Donâ€™t forget to express the bifurcations.*
* &nbsp;
* A flap in the wind
* A sudden change of heart
* I have accounted for
* every unknown start.
* &nbsp;
* *But what of love and culture*
* *And romance too?*
* &nbsp;
* It is all certain
* In the limit of time.
* &nbsp;
* *But until then*
* *what do you believe*
* &nbsp;
* *that we will do?*
