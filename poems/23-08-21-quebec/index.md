**A poem for Québec**

::: poem
-   In stillness Québec flowers.
-   Like the first shot of espresso
-   or your last kiss of the morning
-   and perhaps even after 
-   a perfectly placed line-break, 
-   its flavor rolls and multiples,
-   grows and expands 
-   the way words and sentences 
-   do over full-stops and commas, 
-   the longer you linger. 
-   So linger a little longer. 
-   Come to the realization 
-   that tourists and citizens 
-   are all the same 
-   when they meet your gaze
-   at the windowpane. 
-   Listen to how the children speak 
-   in footsteps and foreign tongues
-   and still find each other. 
-   Notice how even grief 
-   is content to waif and flâneur 
-   along the cobble-covered streets.
-   Later, when you're meeting someone
-   for the first time and their hands 
-   are already all over you,
-   convincing you that 
-   *You are a silly American*
-   *and this is how we will bridge*
-   *the distance of language,*
-   you are ready to surrender.
-   Later, when you're mouthing
-   your goodbyes at the bus stop,
-   you are ready to depart.
