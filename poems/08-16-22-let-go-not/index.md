<div class = "poem">
* Hold on. Forget
* to have have fun. Rerun
* every kiss you ever held
* like tomorrow won't come.
* &nbsp;
* Watch the sun paint the sky
* in thankless strokes. Let your mind 
* play roulette with all your hopes. 
* Tell yourself you have to do this 
* alone. Remind yourself
* you'll never find yourself
* and your way back home.
* &nbsp;
* Don't confess what a mess
* you are. Count your sins
* and every scar. Convince 
* yourself you still want
* what you don't want
* and let the Myrtle tree out front
* shed her pink dress
* without the lonely eyes 
* of her only witness.
