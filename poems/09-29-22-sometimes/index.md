<div class = "poem">
* Sometimes
* you get lucky
* looking out
* over the lake
* when the sun
* and everything 
* – yes –
* Everything! 
* hits you
* like an undeserved
* gift.
* Islands punctuating
* the uniform water.
* Sunbeams coloring
* distant sails.
* Flags surrendering
* their bodies
* to breath. 
* The cold 
* a reminder
* that everything
* – yes –
* Everything! 
* is momentary.
* Sometimes 
* you get lucky
* looking out
* over the lake
* and you remember
* that this
* is enough.
