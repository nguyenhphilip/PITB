<div class = "poem">
* count the possibilities
* on your toes this time,
* as if they were suddenly
* released from the grip
* of boots too small 
* for feet meant to kiss the earth.
* Walk until your feet need rest
* and rest. Worry for awhile
* and let the sand remind you 
* of rocks and change. Then
* go and find yourself
* on the other side of the shore
* where love always fits
* in places it once couldnâ€™t.
