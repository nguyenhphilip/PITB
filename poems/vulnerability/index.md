<div class = "poem">
* You opened up
* like a lotus in the night
* and allowed me
* to feel the shy rhythm
* of your untouched
* heartbeat
* with my callused fingers.
* They traced the surface
* of your little life
* as you guided me
* over the eight scars
* dotting your body
* like flower petals
* on the surface
* of a boundless lake.
