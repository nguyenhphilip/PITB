### Questions for the man

::: poem
- How's a man supposed to feel when
- he lives for nothing more than ends?
- His circumstances pull him one way
- yet something else demands.
- &nbsp;
- Is he honoring the call?
- Is he ready to let go and fall
- so that he can be caught
- by forces he's long forgot?
- To really feel in his bones
- that he was never in fact alone?
- &nbsp;
- He's got money, he's got time, so why
- does he yearn for the sublime?
- &nbsp;
- And when did it become so important
- to be right?
- When did his life turn into
- a series of fights
- &nbsp;
- against the man in the mirror? 
- How did fear
- replace love?
- When did the glove
- become life itself?
- &nbsp;
- Is it possible to change
- while keeping everything
- the same? To hold what
- is no longer his 
- without setting himself 
- aflame?
- &nbsp;
- Does he need his light
- to dwell in the dark?
- Can he put out the flame
- and follow his heart?
