<div class = "poem">
* When someone dies
* are they really gone?
* &nbsp;
* The apples in the garden
* miss your callused touch,
* &nbsp;
* and the Earth, it seems,
* can't weep enough.
* &nbsp;
* Forever feels
* more real
* &nbsp;
* than the rain does.
* You're gone
* &nbsp;
* but the story
* lives on
* &nbsp;
* in a bed
* of neurons
* &nbsp;
* you once said,
* electrical impulses 
* &nbsp;
* with enough power
* to light
* &nbsp;
* entire universes.
* I wish you were here
* &nbsp;
* but you are there
* where stars like you
* &nbsp;
* are meant to burn
* like diamonds studded
* &nbsp;
* in the sky,
* your bright
* &nbsp;
* presence
* forever my light.
