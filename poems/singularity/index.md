<div class = "poem">
* We were in this together
* Once–Inseparable
* like time and gravity,
* &nbsp;
* Our love
* &nbsp;
* A singularity
* That even the Big Bang
* Grew jealous of.
* &nbsp;
* Was it inevitable then
* That we would drift
* &nbsp;
* Apart? You
* &nbsp;
* At the speed of light,
* &nbsp;
* I
* &nbsp;
* The cold crawl
* Of Pluto.
* &nbsp;
* My hope rests
* In cosmic equations,
* Promises
* &nbsp;
* Written on the sky.
* &nbsp;
* It’s out of the question:
* I know we’ll be together
* Once the show is over
* &nbsp;
* And begins again.
* &nbsp;
* But until then
* There is only
* &nbsp;
* This
* &nbsp;
* And less
* On the trail of your blazing star.
