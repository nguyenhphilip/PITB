**Refugee**

::: poem
-   **Like a berry hanging from a vine**
-   that’s the first sign, according to
-   the experts. But you didn’t know it
-   then: back in Vietnam fruit grew 
-   on trees and bushes. It didn’t hide
-   and rupture like cherries too ripe
-   inside your wife’s head. 
-   &nbsp;
-   Even war has its starts, its survivors.
-   All you got was a thud and a body
-   choking on itself. That was when
-   sister and I became refugees, too.
-   &nbsp;
-   One day we told you we saw her,
-   going elsewhere. At last, when you
-   looked, you found her picking fruit
-   in familiar fields, welcoming you home.
-   &nbsp;
