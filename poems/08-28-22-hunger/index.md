<div class = "poem">
* You’re a painting
* You’re a body of photographs
* framed in a movie reel –
* &nbsp;
* You’re music
* You’re a guitar that sings
* on love-stained strings –
* &nbsp;
* You’re something to behold
* a rose never to touch
* a smile just for show –
* &nbsp;
* Does the hunger ever end?
* even in romance and pretense
* even in more-than-just–friends –
* &nbsp;
* You’re poetry
* You’re heaved sonnets to a delicate love song–
* An Oliver and a Dickinson
* &nbsp;
* in a world that wants
* Cummings 
* and Nerudas –
* &nbsp;
* You are freedom
* You are madness kissed
* You are fires to a spark –
* &nbsp;
* You are distance
* You are desire
* You are the reason I walk –
* &nbsp;
* There I go
* yearning
* screaming –
* &nbsp;
* running
