* **Oatmeal**
* &nbsp;
* I’m eating my last bowl of oatmeal,
* looking outside the window
* of a life that was meant for us.
* It’s perfectly framed:
* &nbsp;
* You in the sunlit kitchen
* singing dad rock making ciabatta,
* swaying your small hips to rhythms
* still foreign to me
* &nbsp;
* and I endlessly pondering
* how to fit
* all of it
* onto evenly spaced lines.
* &nbsp;
* Love was delicious to you. 
* The tomatoes you grew
* welcomed eating and everything
* else that needed to be tasted.
* &nbsp;
* I was there to catch them
* with my clumsy hands when
* they at last fell, bringing you down 
* with me to kiss the generous earth.
* &nbsp;
* Now I’m waiting and twisting
* my cold spoon in circles
* until one day I hunger
* for something more than oats.
