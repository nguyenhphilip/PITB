**Lessons from RRR**

<div class = "poem">
* Sometimes a rhyme is good.
* Avoid all shrouds and sometimes
* repetition too. Subtract words 
* as needed, maybe all of them. 
* Keep one ear close to the page
* and listen
* &nbsp;
* to the heartbeat
* &nbsp; 
* of every word, every space,
* every line; see how lines
* define
* and break
* and keep steady the pace
* of a poem. And remember that 
* heart is at the center of it all.
</div>
