### Fly in a café

::: poem
- Curious fly
- with your 
- thousand 
- eyes,
- what is it 
- that you see
- in me? &nbsp; Today
- I am &nbsp; &nbsp; your flower
- and you are &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;my bee
- because &nbsp; it seems
- you can’t get
- enough &nbsp; of me.
- Have I forgotten
- to wash
- this &nbsp; &nbsp; and that
- patch &nbsp; &nbsp; of skin?
- Or were &nbsp; &nbsp; you meant
- to &nbsp; light 
- the night	within?
- I want &nbsp; &nbsp; to crush you
- 	with my hand.
- I want &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to map you
- with my &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; words	
- and hopeless plans.
- You are Plato’s &nbsp; &nbsp; Ideal
- that which cannot
- be &nbsp; touched.
- Perhaps &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; then
- between you
- and &nbsp; &nbsp; me
- this
- is enough.
