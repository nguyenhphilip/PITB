<div class = "poem">
* Look at what all these years
* have done to your hands.
* The hands of a man
* born on two shorelines,
* the hands of an artist
* and engineer who makes knives
* pirouette on stained bamboo boards.
* You still season the chicken
* with ginger and sarcasm,
* and your pho reminds us
* that all love needs
* is bones and water.
* I've tried writing the steps
* down, but what recipe
* could ever contain you?
* Who could hope to recreate
* what you have touched?
* God has made his attempts,
* but the angel you once held
* wants nothing more
* than your hands again.
