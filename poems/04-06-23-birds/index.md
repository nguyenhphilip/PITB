**Birds**

<div class = "poem">
* One moment I’m a philosopher, all words
* and fat with truth. The next I’m a poet
* moonlighting for something new to say.
* I’ve tried on the certainty of equations
* since they promised me the last word.
* But I liked the birds instead, every word
* of theirs a spell that guarantees
* the truth of my existence,
* that truths are truisms
* only sometimes true,
* that Truth itself lies
* within and beyond
* what can be said 
* and has been said
* with words.
