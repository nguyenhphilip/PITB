*Family*

::: poem
-   One day you called,
-   your voice full
-   &nbsp;
-   of sadness and the weight
-   of a history unknown to me.
-   &nbsp;
-   In the back of your throat
-   it had found a place to live
-   &nbsp;
-   like an allergen too familiar
-   with avoidance. Dad’s phở
-   &nbsp;
-   could cure anything.
-   It stewed of meat and bone.
-   &nbsp;
-   But it knew nothing
-   of distance and blood.
-   &nbsp;
-   I learned this too late
-   choking on words
-   &nbsp;
-   across the country, trying
-   to support you, years later.
-   &nbsp;
-   It was your decision:
-   You and mom weren’t talking 
-   &nbsp;
-   anymore. I thought of her then, 
-   alone, in front of the TV at the end
-   &nbsp;
-   of the day, always on,
-   weekends too, and Dad,
-   &nbsp;
-   hiding in the garage,
-   fixing audio devices.
-   &nbsp;
-   Once the war was over
-   no one knew what to do
-   &nbsp;
-   so we went to war
-   with one another instead.
-   &nbsp;
-   This time it felt like 
-   the right time to fire
-   &nbsp;
-   and listen 
-   to the sound of our guns.
