### The heart aches

::: poem
- The heart aches
- for what the mind wants.
- Not smart enough, nowhere close 
- to enlightened, a hungry snail who thinks 
- himself a cat, always searching,
- always on the verge of something, 
- unable to anticipate every variable 
- unknown. In the end
- the heart takes him in, 
- wraps him up in her 
- boundless forgiveness
- knowing that puzzles
- are the opiate of the restless.
- She's had the answers
- all along and reminds him 
- as he twists and agonizes
- in his sleep until sunrise, when again
- he rides off toward the light,
- coat fully unbuttoned, searching
- for shadows on roads 
- that lead him
- back to the beginning.
