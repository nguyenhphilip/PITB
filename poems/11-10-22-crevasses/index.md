<div class = "poem">
* How beautiful it is 
* that landlocked bodies 
* of water will find 
* their way to the ocean 
* through crevasses
* no one else can see.
* That something as light
* as wind can carry 
* the heaviness of traveled waves
* for miles through miles
* of emptiness and longing
* to distant shorelines
* where at last they may find
* a witness to their journey.
* *Rest and stay awhile*, he says,
* *the sand is warm, the sun a friend.*
* *Tell me the story of how you found*
* *your way through the cracks. Show me*
* *how you pieced yourself together*
* *and dared the great escape.*
