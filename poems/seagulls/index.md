<div class = "poem">
* Two birds in unison along a grayed shore walking
* and squawking like inseparable twins
* &nbsp;
* Talking and squealing in that terrifying tongue 
* only they can understand,
* &nbsp;
* Mocking our efforts to tame the unknown, laughing 
* because we canâ€™t in the face of uncertainty.
* &nbsp;
* But for all our differences, I was reassured to find 
* that they shit
* &nbsp;
* In much the same way
* we do.
