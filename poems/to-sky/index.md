<div class = "poem">
* There I threw my sorrows
* in hopes that they would stay.
* Instead you returned tomorrow
* with the weight of yesterday.
* &nbsp;
* Forgive me for asking twice,
* I've already begged in prayerâ€“
* He returned a palm full of ice,
* a reminder that life isn't fair.
* &nbsp;
* The crows made their sighs
* and the sunflowers bowed,
* I screamed shouted and cried
* while you stood indifferent and proud.
* &nbsp;
* The grass gleamed with dew
* as I endured the cold pain,
* while the earth smiled, renewed,
* and thanked me for the rain.
