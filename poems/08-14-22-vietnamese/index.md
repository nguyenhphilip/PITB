<div class = "poem">
* At the age of two I learned 
* of loss and shadows, how both 
* can exist without the light.
* You always had to be 
* two steps ahead Dad said 
* if you wanted to survive.
* Stories that were never mine 
* I carried anyways, one part
* the past I inherited, the rest 
* a future that had no use for dreams
* and romance. Home
* was no longer a roof
* but instead a hunger longing
* for something more than history.
