<div class = "poem">
* In the nook of this morning
* there is the urge for busyness
* and meaning. But the golden
* has just hopped between
* two humans musing
* about the sun. How difficult,
* she thinks, to be so thoughtful.
* Her neck cranes downward
* toward the dirty floorboards
* takes a whiff
* of what is missing
* and suddenly remembers
* the shape of dirt.
