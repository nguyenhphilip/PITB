<div class = "poem">
* There is always the trace of you
* in these places we once called ours.
* I'm here again today and
* now they're only mine and yours.
* &nbsp;
* I come from time to time
* just to see if things have changed.
* Not much has
* though there's a new couch now.
* &nbsp;
* And there is still
* that familiar knot
* in the butter of this biscuit
* as savory as our kisses were.
* &nbsp;
* My coffee is still dark
* like the blades of your eyes,
* your rooibos tea now
* a touch lighter than mine.
* &nbsp;
* I'm here to find
* what only I can see.
* What you always saw,
* what I simply perceived.
* &nbsp;
* I'm stronger this time
* but I still bend like your smile.
* The new couch is staring at me
* and I'm wondering what is right.
