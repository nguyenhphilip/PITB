**Instructions for birding**

::: poem
-   It's not all that different
-   from living well. Go slow.
-   Leave your labels at home.
-   Sit in the unknown
-   and let the silence speak.
-   &nbsp;
-   Wait. Wait a little longer. Wait
-   until you remember: a thing
-   can travel everywhere, just by holding 
-   still.
-   &nbsp;
-   Clear that from your mind.
-   Forget the existence of time.
-   You have all day which is
-   to say a lifetime. 
-   &nbsp;
-   Listen. Look. Look
-   again until you see 
-   nothing is everything,
-   everything in nothing.
-   &nbsp;
-   Let everything find you.
-   Let every thing sing its song.
-   In the songs, a sky.
-   In the sky, a word.
-   In the word, a bird.
