Hello! I'm Phil. My website is a home for my projects, notes, and [writing](https://philintheblank.substack.com).

By day I'm a research analyst at [OHSU](https://www.ohsu.edu/school-of-medicine/child-and-adolescent-psychiatry). I like the R programming language, statistics, and learning. Anything that has an element of hands-on tinkering (poems, coding, playing guitar) is my jam.

By night you can find me reading, writing, noodling on the guitar, practicing handstands, or taking long walks with no particular destination in mind.

If you feel inclined to chat with me about life, your work, and other miscellanea, feel free to reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NguyenHPhil) or at nguy (dot) philip (at) gmail. I would love to connect and meet curious, kind people!
