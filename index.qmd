Hello! I'm Phil. This blog is a home to my projects, notes, and [writing](https://philintheblank.substack.com).

By day I'm a research analyst at [OHSU](https://www.ohsu.edu/school-of-medicine/child-and-adolescent-psychiatry). I like the R programming language, applied statistics (of the Bayesian variety mostly), and learning.

By night you can find me reading, writing, playing guitar, practicing handstands, or taking long walks with no particular destination in mind.

If you feel inclined to chat with me about life, your work, and other miscellanea in a nerdy way, feel free to reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NguyenHPhil)! I would love to connect and meet curious, kind people.
