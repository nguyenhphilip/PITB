<div class = "poem">
* While the world sleeps
* I wake
* into the soft unfolding
* of morning.
* &nbsp;
* Between stanzas I’ve suddenly
* forgotten (forgive me Szymborska)
* is clasped
* a single thread
* &nbsp;
* of auburn.
* It’s been months since
* I last found you
* rising
* &nbsp;
* and falling
* like a fawn yet nuzzled
* by the cold breath
* of winter
* &nbsp;
* and demands
* beside me
* beneath familiar sheets.
* My poems miss
* &nbsp;
* your eyes,
* my fingers
* your scars,
* my world
* &nbsp;
* your gravity.
* The strand still lingers
* and dresses herself daily
* in the same sunlight
* &nbsp;
* and the same unturned pages
* I still can't remember,
* still waits for her sisters
* to come again, loosen up
* &nbsp;
* and curl themselves
* around words, lines, and stories
* that have yet to be read
* by more than my eyes
* &nbsp;
* alone.
