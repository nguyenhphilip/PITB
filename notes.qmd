*A non-exhaustive archive of loose notes on what I'm learning, reading, or thinking about. Note (heh) that these notes are incomplete at best. They're informal attempts at gaining a deeper understanding of the things that currently have my attention. I strangely enjoy doing this sort of thing and will update my notes only when I feel like it. I am sharing them here though so that my notes are somewhat legible and coherent for the random stranger who may find themselves in this part of the web.*
