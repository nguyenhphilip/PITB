Hello! I'm Phil. This blog is simply a home to my projects and writing.

By day I'm a graduate student in [Complex Systems and Data Science](https://vermontcomplexsystems.org) working on the [ABCD Study](https://abcdstudy.org). My research interests include: mental health, youth development, network science, and complex systems.

By night (or when I'm not playing academic) you can find me reading, writing, playing guitar, slacklining, practicing handstands, or taking long walks with no particular destination in mind. The former provides me an interface with the world. The latter feeds and fulfills my soul.
