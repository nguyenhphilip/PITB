<div class = "poem">
* A Black birder
* subjected to 
* attempted murder
* by words 
* so calculated
* that even 
* the birds
* could no longer
* sing–
* &nbsp;
* A Black woman
* shot dead
* in her bed
* holding dreams
* that will 
* never 
* find their way 
* to this harsh 
* reality–
* &nbsp;
* A Black man
* his body pinned
* under 
* the flagpole
* of a white
* Knee–
* A body 
* ripped
* of breath–
* A life stripped
* of color–
* Killed–
* by and with
* a weapon
* deadlier than History–
