<div class = "poem">
* I’m sailing,
* I’m drifting on
* a rusty boat
* in open sea
* heading nowhere
* and everywhere
* like birch seeds floating
* on the warm breath
* of a Vermont summer,
* searching for a place
* to land and settle,
* an identity to inhabit
* and call my own.
* &nbsp;
* It’s a story I can’t get over, mine,
* this collection of half-finished poems
* full of half-hearted lines
* that sketch the color of my thoughts.
* Answers are supposed to help
* but the questions
* are quicker to rise.
* &nbsp;
* Still, beneath the sail
* lies the redeeming oar. 
* Grab it and propel yourself forward
* into the winds of opportunity,
* and when the storm inevitably comes
* as it always does
* ride the waves
* and soar above
* the tempests that seek
* to cloud the light
* bursting from your heart.
