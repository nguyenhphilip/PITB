This is a project I worked on for my Bayesian Statistics course. My partner and I explored Bayesian Principal Component Analysis (BPCA) as an extension of PCA and PPCA on MNIST and an econological dataset. I learned quite a bit about PCA in the process! The final report can be found [here](https://github.com/nguyenhphilip/stat330project/blob/main/STAT_330_Preprint_draft.pdf).
