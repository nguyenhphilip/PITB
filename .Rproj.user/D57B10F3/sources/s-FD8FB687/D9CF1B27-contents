<div class = "poem">
* Will you start the day now?
* Time can only cradle you
* for so long, your body so
* heavy with duty and obligation.
* &nbsp;
* The questions tugging at your soul
* can wait; she will be there
* at the end of the day, and if not
* perhaps tomorrow â€“ well at least
* you have yourself.
* &nbsp;
* And if not that, well,
* time will be waiting,
* poised like the sliver of a grin,
* ready to swing your life away.
