I built a searchable data dictionary and ABCD release notes all in one place, which addresses some of the navigational issues I had with NDA's data dictionary.

Unfortunately I can't show the app's source code due to confidentiality, but this is a GIF demonstrating what it does.

Built using R and Shiny. Data pulled from [NDA website](https://nda.nih.gov/).
