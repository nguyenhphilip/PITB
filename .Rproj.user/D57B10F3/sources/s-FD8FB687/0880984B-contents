<div class = "poem">
* A season between seasons
* a bridge crossed by the plentiful few,
* Adults seek it endlessly
* though already the children knew.
* &nbsp;
* Don’t bother with asking –– 
* we’re sworn to secrecy.
* I myself have nothing to say
* though clues are not certainties:
* &nbsp;
* Between one breath of Winter
* and one sigh of Spring,
* go to where the avians
* dare to fly and sing.
