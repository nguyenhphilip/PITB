<div class = "poem">
* so many years left
* by the measure of things
* &nbsp;
* though memory and circumstance
* don’t seem to agree with me.
* &nbsp;
* they only see
* the distance
* &nbsp;
* between who we were then
* and who we are now.
* &nbsp;
* i can’t tell if you’re smiling
* or if that’s the wrinkle
* &nbsp;
* in your eye
* reminding me
* &nbsp;
* of where we’ve been
* and where we’re still going.
* &nbsp;
* there’s not much
* of that for us anymore,
* &nbsp;
* we’ve had our fair share
* of looking ahead,
* &nbsp;
* but you’re still surprised
* when you find my fingers
* &nbsp;
* in the thicket of your silver threads,
* grazing on skin
* &nbsp;
* now deliciously peppered
* with time.
</div>
