More and more I find myself holding the pain of others. Itâ€™s a privileged place to be, to serve as the anchor that people hang onto when the currents of life become too tumultuous to bear, to guide through that necessary journey of self-annihilation before any growth may take place. 

I too am in the process of shedding old skin and paving new paths. The way forward is always dark and undefined, but something bright is coalescing on the edge of the horizon. So long as we continue walking, we are already there.
