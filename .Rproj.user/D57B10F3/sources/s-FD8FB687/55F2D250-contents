<div class = "poem">
* While the yellow-jackets mingle with
* the Azaleas and the sunflowers
* and the people with only each other,
* You were there in the sky
* on a young branch navigating
* the heights of which
* far too few have seen,
* crawling toward the sun.
* You weaved through the leaves
* and fought against the voice of Mother,
* and finally, finally,
* you reached the peak.
* Then, just like the robins,
* just like the timid sparrows
* singing without the need for recognition,
* you opened the crimson shell 
* housing your weightless wings
* and flew to the only place you knew
* was home.
