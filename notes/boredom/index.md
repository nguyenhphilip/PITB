*This was possibly started due to boredom.*

What is boredom? It's easier to examine the phenomology of boredom and its possible solutions (this presupposes that boredom is a problem, which it may not be).

A good place to start might be to characterize it as a feeling of unease associated with a lack of activity. From here we can already see that being engaged in something does not necessarily free you from boredom. For example, we sometimes find ourselves feeling bored at parties when the conversations aren't so great. This implies that an element of immersion is involved in boredom. Immersion is hard to force yourself to feel (to the bored person: "*just* have more fun!"). But it doesn't seem impossible either to nudge yourself toward deeper forms of engagement. This seems to be a promise of attentional practices (e.g. meditation) and has been true of my experience in some situations. 

Back to the definition. A lack of activity does not necessarily have to induce a feeling of unease. Is it then this feeling of unease that is the boredom, or is a lack of activity/engagement/flow necessarily intertwined in the definition?

The philosopher Seneca has some spot-on descriptions of the phenomology of boredom. From the [IEP](https://iep.utm.edu/boredom/):

>Thence comes mourning and melancholy and the thousand waverings of an unsettled mind, which its aspirations hold in suspense, and then disappointment renders melancholy. **Thence comes that feeling which makes men loathe their own leisure and complain that they themselves have nothing to be busy with.**

Leisure is linked to free time, begging another question: is boredom more prevalent in modernity than it was in older times? On one hand there seems to be many more ways to engage ourselves now than there was in the past. Netflix, Youtube, books, email, instant messaging, TV, and so on. Modern enterintainment. We should be less bored right? Well, it's possible that having too many options leads to decision paralysis, and we end up more bored than if we only had a few possibilities for engagement. Also boredom has to be related to how well off we are as a society. The better off we are, the more opportunities we have for leisure, and therefore boredom. We may have more options for entertainment, but this may be overwhelming.

What if entertainment has replaced forms of engagement that provide the kind of meaning that makes us feel connected to something more? That are better at staving off deeper, knottier forms of ennui? This is what the philosopher Blaise Pascal seems to think. He says that boredom is "the natural state of a human being *without* God." Find God, expel boredom. Easy peasy. 

Okay maybe not, but suppose we buy this argument. Why? What exactly, then, does it mean to be *with* God? I suppose it might work the way meditation does, where your experience of things encompasses something more meta...

Boredom seems like a crime against our own innate nature. We are born wholly curious, interested, risk-taking and in love with the world. We want to learn and understand things.

Busyness is the destroyer of boredom? Maybe, and also of fun and joy. It's a poor substitute for both, and yet it's so pervasive. Again, it's not necessarily about how much we are doing and how occupied we are. We also have to consider the quality of the experience and our engagements.

	- Boredom is important. Everyone talks about people with too much anxiety and that is a problem. But someone with too little anxiety â€“ you won't find them in a psychiatrist's office. You find them in morgues and prisons. Their lack of anxiety gets them into trouble. Too much boredom could be bad, but if you strip someone of their boredom they lose the motivation to explore, either externally in the world or internally in their own heads. **And I think that's the problem with smartphones. There's a line from the chairman of Netflix: "we don't compete with other streaming companies. We compete with sleep." And I can imagine the heads of Facebook and Twitter saying "we don't compete with other companies, we compete with life." Normally boredom would spark you to go and do something. Now boredom makes you pick up your phone.**
