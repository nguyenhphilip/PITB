I’m not one to take horoscopes and personality tests too seriously (though they can be fun), but discovering my enneagram type (I’m a 4w5) was actually helpful. Much of what I read on it validated what I’ve already recognized in myself with more precise language. It provided a clear description of thought and behavior patterns that I struggle with, as well as directions for growth.

I’m at my best when there’s a balance between how much time I spend in my imagination and how often I interface with the wider world (*touch grass*). The former has always been a refuge, an escape. It’s a place where I can be immersed in my creativity. But spending too much time there makes me deeply unhappy. The animal inside of me who needs skin and motion, sunshine and handstands ends up being neglected. They are both connected and suffer when one or the other is left by the wayside.

Outside of work and reading and sometimes writing, I’m not sure what to do with myself. I know that I can’t do these things all day based on how they make me feel.
