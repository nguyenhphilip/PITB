Lately I've been feeling stuck. I haven't felt inspired to write or do much of what I usually do. Whenever I try to recommit to, say, learning a new song on the guitar or writing another blog post, my desire dwindles shortly after I start, especially with regard to my writing.

This makes me feel sad and restless. For the longest time I thought I wanted to spend the majority of my days writing, but maybe this isn't as true as I once thought it was. Though whenever I try to do something different, I find nothing has the same appeal, despite my lack of fulfillment in what I've recently written. Have I lost my ability to "stick to" hard things? Or is it a sign that parts of my life are in need of an update?

Sometimes people say you should go back to your "why" in periods like these. Writing has always been my refuge, a practice where I discover what I really think or how I feel about something. Well, not much has compelled me to write lately. (Other than my stuckness, lol.) It's not that there isn't anything to write about. It's just that I don't want to put in the effort, at least with regard to creating long-form pieces. 

This is ok, I know--there is much more to life than writing blog posts and essays. It was Annie Dillard, after all, who once said to a group of aspiring writers that they should have more to their life than reading and writing. This resonates because I know I need to live differently. This, in turn, might give me something more interesting to write about.

My job doesn't require much of me, so I'm left with a lot of flexibility and freedom in how I choose to spend my days. This is usually thought of as a boon, and in many ways it is. I've had the opportunity to do things that would be more difficult to do in a traditional 9-5 job. That said, I lack the kinds of commitments that would otherwise give shape to my life. Freedom is only meaningful when situated against constraints. Independent of them it spurs anxiety and existential dizziness. 

When I'm able to withstand the uncertainty and absence of structure, I find that I'm not who I thought I was. Writing is only a small part of my life. I need more than words to constitute it. Still, it feels like an act of surrender at times. Much like in meditation though, this might be what I need.

What I'm currently playing with, instead of trying to write long-form:

- Learning the [Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/) development framework
- Writing poetry, again. This mode of writing feels different than writing long-form. And I'm much more insecure about it. Hence, it's exciting. My current obsession is [Rilke](https://poetrysociety.org/poems/the-first-elegy). His work brings me to another plane of existence.
- [The Four Immeasurables](https://unfetteredmind.org/four-immeasurables/), and generally expanding my meditation practice. 
- I'm considering meditation teaching as a way to serve others, as well as offering space and a listening ear to those who need it. I've been doing these things more or less with [SeekHealing](https://www.seekhealing.org/) and my friends, which has been gratifying.

I've been in Vermont for six years. I love it here. But something is calling for a change. This is why I'm considering a move to New York City. Because sometimes you just gotta [blow up your life](https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/in-praise-of-blowing-up-your-life). It's not totally clear what this will resolve, but sometimes jumping into the deep end is exactly how you figure things out.
